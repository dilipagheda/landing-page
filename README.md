# Landing Page Project

## About the project

This project is about building an interactive landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It has primariliy following key features achieved through plain JavaScript.
  - Programmatically builds navigation based on number of sections
  - Scrolls to anchors from navigation using smooth scroll animation
  - Highlights section in viewport upon scrolling using css animation
  - Highlights the menu option for the section currently in viewport

## Technology used

- HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript :satisfied:

## Optimisation

Optimisation for DOM updates is achieved using conditional rendering and custom events. For example, when user scrolls, scroll handler calculates which section is on the viewport and then updates the application state. Inside, application state function a decision is taken whether to request for DOM update or not.

### Application state object

Application state looks like below where it keeps track of what is currently active section, previsouly active section and a function that will update the state and request DOM update via `updateActiveSectionEvent` if a condition is met for it.

Note: It is important to set state via `setActiveSection` function only else DOM render will not trigger. (kind of like React! :smiley:)

```
const APP_STATE = {
    current_active_sectionId: null,
    previous_active_sectionId: null,
    setActiveSection(sectionId) {
        //1. check for correctness
        if(sectionId && typeof sectionId === 'string') {
            //2. check if the state changed
            if(sectionId !== this.current_active_sectionId) {
                this.previous_active_sectionId = this.current_active_sectionId;
                this.current_active_sectionId = sectionId;

                //create and dispatch the event to update active section
                const updateActiveSectionEvent = new Event('update-active-section');
                document.dispatchEvent(updateActiveSectionEvent);
            }
        }
    }
};

```

Also, in order to minimise `run-to-completion` code and thus blocking the single thread, custom events are used to modularise code and to use JavaScript's asynchrnous nature such as event queue.

## Further updates
- Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load). setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
- Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Update/change the design/content.
- Make sections collapsible.
